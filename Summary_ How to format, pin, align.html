<p><strong>SAFE AREA/SUPERVIEW: (Pinning/Constraining Single objects)</strong></p>
<p>Go to constraints (square w/ lines around it)- set constraints to 0 on all sides</p>
<p>To make it cover the whole screen on landscape, select constraints &gt;&gt; trailing/leading- and make them equal to SUPERVIEW, also make sure the constant is set to 0 .</p>
<p><strong>ALLIGNING:</strong></p>
<p>Go to alignment (bar graphs) and click horizontally/vertically in container</p>
<p><strong>CONTAINERS/SUBVIEWS/STACK VIEWS (embedding views)- FULL STEPS</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Drag new view/embed objects in new subview based on location</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hold on all views and embed them in a new stack view</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Give stack view constraints- go to square w/ lines around it and set constraints to 0 on all sides- To make it cover the whole screen on landscape, select constraints &gt;&gt; trailing/leading/bottom/top- and make them equal to SUPERVIEW, also make sure the constant is set to 0 .</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Go to stack view, attributes, and select distribution to fill equally</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now make sure that all objects in the same stack view have their own stack views, and then select those stack views/those solo objects in their own stack view, and make those vertically/horizontally aligned in their container, or pinned</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select all containers, change background to default/transparent</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>DONE!!</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>HOW TO CLEAN UP YOUR BUTTONS IF THEY ARE TIGHTENED UP AFTER PUT IN STACK VIEWS:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Select the button</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Go to constraints (square w/ lines on side), and change the width to custom sizes chosen; Add those constraints</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Look at warning (fixed width constraint)- click on error and set the constraint to being greater than custom width so it will automatically adjust</p>
</li>
